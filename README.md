# ElevateLabs_Task-6

This project involved analyzing monthly sales trends using SQL aggregate functions. By grouping data by year and month, we calculated monthly revenue using SUM() and order volume using COUNT(DISTINCT). 

The results were filtered for 2023 and sorted chronologically. 
This task demonstrated key skills in SQL data aggregation, time-based grouping, and generating valuable information for business reporting.
